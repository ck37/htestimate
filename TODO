TODO

Functionality
- IN PROGRESS: Add support for constant treatment effects and sharp null approximations.
- IN PROGRESS: Support clustering.
- Other extensions listed in the PDF: covariate adjustment, LATE, Hajek estimator, Ratio estimation.
- TODO: see if assignment levels can be character strings.

Documentation
- Describe the project in Readme.md
- Add examples to htEstimate roxygen and Readme.md
- IN PROGRESS: Add header comments to all functions.
- Make sure all function bodies are well commented.

Testing
- IN PROGRESS: Test an htEstimate based on a re-randomized probMatrix (ri package or otherwise)
- Test a probability matrix based on re-randomization (ri package or otherwise)
- Compare HT results to those of additional packages (samplingVarEst, SamplingBook)
- Add more test cases.

Performance
- Benchmark performance on a large example.
- Vectorize more of the operations and/or use matrix operations.
