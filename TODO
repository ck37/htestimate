Documentation
- IN PROGRESS: Add header comments to all functions.
- Describe the project in Readme.md
- Make sure all function bodies are well commented.

Testing
- IN PROGRESS: Test an htEstimate based on a re-randomized probMatrix (ri package or otherwise)
- Test a probability matrix based on re-randomization (ri package or otherwise)
- Compare HT results to those of additional packages (samplingVarEst, SamplingBook)
- Add more test cases.
